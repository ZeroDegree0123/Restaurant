# Zachs Burgers

Zach's Burgers is a family owned Restaurant that has been around longer than you've been Alive! This app is a fully dynamic restaurant website with basic ordering functionality. I had a lot a fun with this project focusing on styling the website to compete with other popular franchises amongst the web. The site includes an assortment of pages including a menu, a career path site, and more!

## Next Steps

For future developments on Zach's Burgers I would like to implement a order feature allowing users to search an area for nearby restaurants and being able to place an order. I would also like to create a profile page allowing users to manage there account information as well as view there rewards progress. Speaking of rewards I would like to create a place to view rewards progress within the profile page. Possibly add full order functionality.
