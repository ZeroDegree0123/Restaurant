# Zachs Burgers

This app is Front-end based and themed as a restaurant. Users can sign-up and browse through the websites different pages. The purpose of this app is to mimic what a restaurants site would like, and to showcase my Front-end skills. The app does not have a lot of funtionality other than being able to sign-up as a user.

## Next Steps

For future developments on Zach's Burgers I would like to implement a order feature allowing users to search an area for nearby restaurants and being able to place an order. I would also like to create a profile page allowing users to manage there account information as well as view there rewards progress. Speaking of rewards I would like to create a place to view rewards progress within the profile page. Possibly add full order functionality.
